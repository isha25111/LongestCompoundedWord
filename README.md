# LongestCompoundedWord
Logic used: To sort the words and then traverse the large data and find the compounded words.

Read a list of word from the input file.

The input file can be attached accordingly.

Sorted the input lexographically and by length also to reduce the time taken to traverse all the words.

Used recursive algorithm and the Memoization table to store the data and effectively use it to reduce the time complexity.

Overall complexity is:O(N*logN).
